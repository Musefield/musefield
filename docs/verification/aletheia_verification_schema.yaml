    Checklist and scoring framework for Aletheia’s integrity audits.
    Each phase receives a 0-100 score based on weighted metrics.
  weights:
    coherence: 0.30
    accuracy: 0.20
    efficiency: 0.15
    transparency: 0.15
    regeneration: 0.10
    reproducibility: 0.10
  scoring_method:
    - coherence: "mean(coherence_index) × 100"
    - accuracy: "(1 - error_rate) × 100"
    - efficiency: "normalized throughput / resource_use × 100"
    - transparency: "documented_decisions / total_decisions × 100"
    - regeneration: "fund_allocation_ratio × 100"
    - reproducibility: "rebuild_success_rate × 100"
    - total_score: "Σ(weight_i × metric_i)"
  grade_scale:
    A: ">=90  — Exemplary alignment"
    B: "80–89 — Stable operation"
    C: "70–79 — Needs improvement"
    D: "60–69 — At risk"
    F: "<60   — Failing"
